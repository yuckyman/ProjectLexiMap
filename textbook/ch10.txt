CHAPTER 10

Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks
with Keras



Birds inspired us to fly, burdock plants inspired Velcro, and nature has inspired countless more inventions. It seems only logical, then, to look at the brain’s architecture for inspiration on how to build an intelligent machine. This is the logic that sparked artificial neural networks (ANNs): an ANN is a Machine Learning model inspired by the networks of biological neurons found in our brains. However, although planes were inspired by birds, they don’t have to flap their wings. Similarly, ANNs have gradually become quite different from their biological cousins. Some researchers even argue that we should drop the biological analogy altogether (e.g., by saying “units” rather than “neurons”), lest we restrict our creativity to biologically plausible systems.1
ANNs are at the very core of Deep Learning. They are versatile, powerful, and scalable, making them ideal to tackle large and highly complex Machine Learning tasks such as classifying billions of images (e.g., Google Images), powering speech recognition services (e.g., Apple’s Siri), recommending the best videos to watch to hundreds of millions of users every day (e.g., YouTube), or learning to beat the world champion at the game of Go (DeepMind’s AlphaGo).
The first part of this chapter introduces artificial neural networks, starting with a quick tour of the very first ANN architectures and leading up to Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), which are heavily used today (other architectures will be explored in the next chapters). In the second part, we will look at how to implement neural networks using the popular Keras API. This is a beautifully designed and simple high-

level API for building, training, evaluating, and running neural networks. But don’t be fooled by its simplicity: it is expressive and flexible enough to let you build a wide variety of neural network architectures. In fact, it will probably be sufficient for most of your use cases. And should you ever need extra flexibility, you can always write custom Keras components using its lower-level API, as we will see in Chapter 12.
But first, let’s go back in time to see how artificial neural networks came to be!
From Biological to Artificial Neurons
Surprisingly, ANNs have been around for quite a while: they were first introduced back in 1943 by the neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and the mathematician Walter Pitts. In their landmark paper2 “A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity,” McCulloch and Pitts presented a simplified computational model of how biological neurons might work together in animal brains to perform complex computations using propositional logic. This was the first artificial neural network architecture. Since then many other architectures have been invented, as we will see.
The early successes of ANNs led to the widespread belief that we would soon be conversing with truly intelligent machines. When it became clear in the 1960s that this promise would go unfulfilled (at least for quite a while), funding flew elsewhere, and ANNs entered a long winter. In the early 1980s, new architectures were invented and better training techniques were developed, sparking a revival of interest in connectionism (the study of neural networks). But progress was slow, and by the 1990s other powerful Machine Learning techniques were invented, such as Support Vector Machines (see Chapter 5). These techniques seemed to offer better results and stronger theoretical foundations than ANNs, so once again the study of neural networks was put on hold.
We are now witnessing yet another wave of interest in ANNs. Will this wave die out like the previous ones did? Well, here are a few good reasons to believe that this time is different and that the renewed interest in ANNs will have a much more profound impact on our lives:
•	There is now a huge quantity of data available to train neural networks, and ANNs frequently outperform other ML techniques on very large and complex problems.
•	The tremendous increase in computing power since the 1990s now makes it possible to train large neural networks in a reasonable amount of time. This is in part due to Moore’s law (the number of components in integrated circuits has

doubled about every 2 years over the last 50 years), but also thanks to the gaming industry, which has stimulated the production of powerful GPU cards by the millions. Moreover, cloud platforms have made this power accessible to everyone.
•	The training algorithms have been improved. To be fair they are only slightly different from the ones used in the 1990s, but these relatively small tweaks have had a huge positive impact.
•	Some theoretical limitations of ANNs have turned out to be benign in practice. For example, many people thought that ANN training algorithms were doomed because they were likely to get stuck in local optima, but it turns out that this is rather rare in practice (and when it is the case, they are usually fairly close to the global optimum).
•	ANNs seem to have entered a virtuous circle of funding and progress. Amazing products based on ANNs regularly make the headline news, which pulls more and more attention and funding toward them, resulting in more and more progress and even more amazing products.

Biological Neurons
Before we discuss artificial neurons, let’s take a quick look at a biological neuron (represented in Figure 10-1). It is an unusual-looking cell mostly found in animal brains. It’s composed of a cell body containing the nucleus and most of the cell’s complex components, many branching extensions called dendrites, plus one very long extension called the axon. The axon’s length may be just a few times longer than the cell body, or up to tens of thousands of times longer. Near its extremity the axon splits off into many branches called telodendria, and at the tip of these branches are minuscule structures called synaptic terminals (or simply synapses), which are connected to the dendrites or cell bodies of other neurons.3 Biological neurons produce short electrical impulses called action potentials (APs, or just signals) which travel along the axons and make the synapses release chemical signals called neurotransmitters. When a neuron receives a sufficient amount of these neurotransmitters within a few milliseconds, it fires its own electrical impulses (actually, it depends on the neurotransmitters, as some of them inhibit the neuron from firing).







3	They are not actually attached, just so close that they can very quickly exchange chemical signals.
 
 
Figure 10-1. Biological neuron4
Thus, individual biological neurons seem to behave in a rather simple way, but they are organized in a vast network of billions, with each neuron typically connected to thousands of other neurons. Highly complex computations can be performed by a network of fairly simple neurons, much like a complex anthill can emerge from the combined efforts of simple ants. The architecture of biological neural networks (BNNs)5 is still the subject of active research, but some parts of the brain have been mapped, and it seems that neurons are often organized in consecutive layers, especially in the cerebral cortex (i.e., the outer layer of your brain), as shown in Figure 10-2.

Logical Computations with Neurons
McCulloch and Pitts proposed a very simple model of the biological neuron, which later became known as an artificial neuron: it has one or more binary (on/off) inputs and one binary output. The artificial neuron activates its output when more than a certain number of its inputs are active. In their paper, they showed that even with such a simplified model it is possible to build a network of artificial neurons that computes any logical proposition you want. To see how such a network works, let’s build a few ANNs that perform various logical computations (see Figure 10-3), assuming that a neuron is activated when at least two of its inputs are active.

Figure 10-3. ANNs performing simple logical computations

Let’s see what these networks do:
•	The first network on the left is the identity function: if neuron A is activated, then neuron C gets activated as well (since it receives two input signals from neuron A); but if neuron A is off, then neuron C is off as well.
•	The second network performs a logical AND: neuron C is activated only when both neurons A and B are activated (a single input signal is not enough to activate neuron C).
•	The third network performs a logical OR: neuron C gets activated if either neuron A or neuron B is activated (or both).
•	Finally, if we suppose that an input connection can inhibit the neuron’s activity (which is the case with biological neurons), then the fourth network computes a slightly more complex logical proposition: neuron C is activated only if neuron A is active and neuron B is off. If neuron A is active all the time, then you get a logical NOT: neuron C is active when neuron B is off, and vice versa.
You can imagine how these networks can be combined to compute complex logical expressions (see the exercises at the end of the chapter for an example).
The Perceptron
The Perceptron is one of the simplest ANN architectures, invented in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt. It is based on a slightly different artificial neuron (see Figure 10-4) called a threshold logic unit (TLU), or sometimes a linear threshold unit (LTU). The inputs and output are numbers (instead of binary on/off values), and each input connection is associated with a weight. The TLU computes a weighted sum of its inputs (z = w1 x1
+ w2 x2 + ⋯ + wn xn = x⊺ w), then applies a step function to that sum and outputs the result: hw(x) = step(z), where z = x⊺ w.

Figure 10-4. Threshold logic unit: an artificial neuron which computes a weighted sum of its inputs then applies a step function
 
The most common step function used in Perceptrons is the Heaviside step function
(see Equation 10-1). Sometimes the sign function is used instead.

Equation 10-1. Common step functions used in Perceptrons (assuming threshold = 0)
 

heaviside  z  =
 
0 if z < 0	sgn z =
1 if z ≥ 0
 
−1 if z < 0
0	if z = 0
+1 if z > 0
 
A single TLU can be used for simple linear binary classification. It computes a linear combination of the inputs, and if the result exceeds a threshold, it outputs the positive class. Otherwise it outputs the negative class (just like a Logistic Regression or linear SVM classifier). You could, for example, use a single TLU to classify iris flowers based on petal length and width (also adding an extra bias feature x0 = 1, just like we did in previous chapters). Training a TLU in this case means finding the right values for w0, w1, and w2 (the training algorithm is discussed shortly).
A Perceptron is simply composed of a single layer of TLUs,7 with each TLU connected to all the inputs. When all the neurons in a layer are connected to every neuron in the previous layer (i.e., its input neurons), the layer is called a fully connected layer, or a dense layer. The inputs of the Perceptron are fed to special passthrough neurons called input neurons: they output whatever input they are fed. All the input neurons form the input layer. Moreover, an extra bias feature is generally added (x0 = 1): it is typically represented using a special type of neuron called a bias neuron, which outputs 1 all the time. A Perceptron with two inputs and three outputs is represented in Figure 10-5. This Perceptron can classify instances simultaneously into three different binary classes, which makes it a multilabel classifier.













7	The name Perceptron is sometimes used to mean a tiny network with a single TLU.
 
 
Figure 10-5. Architecture of a Perceptron with two input neurons, one bias neuron, and three output neurons
Thanks to the magic of linear algebra, Equation 10-2 makes it possible to efficiently compute the outputs of a layer of artificial neurons for several instances at once.
Equation 10-2. Computing the outputs of a fully connected layer
hW, b X  = ϕ XW + b 
In this equation:
•	As always, X represents the matrix of input features. It has one row per instance and one column per feature.
•	The weight matrix W contains all the connection weights except for the ones from the bias neuron. It has one row per input neuron and one column per artificial neuron in the layer.
•	The bias vector b contains all the connection weights between the bias neuron and the artificial neurons. It has one bias term per artificial neuron.8
•	The function ϕ is called the activation function: when the artificial neurons are TLUs, it is a step function (but we will discuss other activation functions shortly).
So, how is a Perceptron trained? The Perceptron training algorithm proposed by Rosenblatt was largely inspired by Hebb’s rule. In his 1949 book The Organization of Behavior (Wiley), Donald Hebb suggested that when a biological neuron triggers another neuron often, the connection between these two neurons grows stronger. Siegrid Löwel later summarized Hebb’s idea in the catchy phrase, “Cells that fire

8	In mathematics, the sum of a matrix (XW) and a vector (b) is undefined. However, in Data Science, we allow “broadcasting”: we add the vector to every row in the matrix.
 
together, wire together”; that is, the connection weight between two neurons tends to increase when they fire simultaneously. This rule later became known as Hebb’s rule (or Hebbian learning). Perceptrons are trained using a variant of this rule that takes into account the error made by the network when it makes a prediction; the Perceptron learning rule reinforces connections that help reduce the error. More specifically, the Perceptron is fed one training instance at a time, and for each instance it makes its predictions. For every output neuron that produced a wrong prediction, it reinforces the connection weights from the inputs that would have contributed to the correct prediction. The rule is shown in Equation 10-3.
Equation 10-3. Perceptron learning rule (weight update)
wi, j next step  = wi, j + η yj −	xi

In this equation:
•	wi, j is the connection weight between the ith input neuron and the jth output neuron.
•	xi is the ith input value of the current training instance.

•	y j is the output of the jth output neuron for the current training instance.
•	yj is the target output of the jth output neuron for the current training instance.
•	η is the learning rate.
The decision boundary of each output neuron is linear, so Perceptrons are incapable of learning complex patterns (just like Logistic Regression classifiers). However, if the training instances are linearly separable, Rosenblatt demonstrated that this algorithm would converge to a solution.9 This is called the Perceptron convergence theorem.
Scikit-Learn provides a Perceptron class that implements a single-TLU network. It can be used pretty much as you would expect—for example, on the iris dataset (introduced in Chapter 4):
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.linear_model import Perceptron
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data[:, (2, 3)] # petal length, petal width
y = (iris.target == 0).astype(np.int) # Iris setosa?


9	Note that this solution is not unique: when data points are linearly separable, there is an infinity of hyperplanes that can separate them.
 
per_clf = Perceptron() per_clf.fit(X, y)
y_pred = per_clf.predict([[2, 0.5]])
You may have noticed that the Perceptron learning algorithm strongly resembles Stochastic Gradient Descent. In fact, Scikit-Learn’s Perceptron class is equivalent to using an SGDClassifier with the following hyperparameters: loss="perceptron", learning_rate="constant", eta0=1 (the learning rate), and penalty=None (no regularization).
Note that contrary to Logistic Regression classifiers, Perceptrons do not output a class probability; rather, they make predictions based on a hard threshold. This is one reason to prefer Logistic Regression over Perceptrons.
In their 1969 monograph Perceptrons, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert highlighted a number of serious weaknesses of Perceptrons—in particular, the fact that they are incapable of solving some trivial problems (e.g., the Exclusive OR (XOR) classification problem; see the left side of Figure 10-6). This is true of any other linear classification model (such as Logistic Regression classifiers), but researchers had expected much more from Perceptrons, and some were so disappointed that they dropped neural networks altogether in favor of higher-level problems such as logic, problem solving, and search.
It turns out that some of the limitations of Perceptrons can be eliminated by stacking multiple Perceptrons. The resulting ANN is called a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). An MLP can solve the XOR problem, as you can verify by computing the output of the MLP represented on the right side of Figure 10-6: with inputs (0, 0) or (1, 1), the network outputs 0, and with inputs (0, 1) or (1, 0) it outputs 1. All connections have a weight equal to 1, except the four connections where the weight is shown. Try verifying that this network indeed solves the XOR problem!

Figure 10-6. XOR classification problem and an MLP that solves it
 
The Multilayer Perceptron and Backpropagation
An MLP is composed of one (passthrough) input layer, one or more layers of TLUs, called hidden layers, and one final layer of TLUs called the output layer (see Figure 10-7). The layers close to the input layer are usually called the lower layers, and the ones close to the outputs are usually called the upper layers. Every layer except the output layer includes a bias neuron and is fully connected to the next layer.

Figure 10-7. Architecture of a Multilayer Perceptron with two inputs, one hidden layer of four neurons, and three output neurons (the bias neurons are shown here, but usually they are implicit)

The signal flows only in one direction (from the inputs to the outputs), so this architecture is an example of a feedforward neural network (FNN).


When an ANN contains a deep stack of hidden layers,10 it is called a deep neural network (DNN). The field of Deep Learning studies DNNs, and more generally models containing deep stacks of computations. Even so, many people talk about Deep Learning whenever neural networks are involved (even shallow ones).
For many years researchers struggled to find a way to train MLPs, without success. But in 1986, David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton, and Ronald Williams published a


10	In the 1990s, an ANN with more than two hidden layers was considered deep. Nowadays, it is common to see ANNs with dozens of layers, or even hundreds, so the definition of “deep” is quite fuzzy.
 
groundbreaking paper11 that introduced the backpropagation training algorithm, which is still used today. In short, it is Gradient Descent (introduced in Chapter 4) using an efficient technique for computing the gradients automatically:12 in just two passes through the network (one forward, one backward), the backpropagation algorithm is able to compute the gradient of the network’s error with regard to every single model parameter. In other words, it can find out how each connection weight and each bias term should be tweaked in order to reduce the error. Once it has these gradients, it just performs a regular Gradient Descent step, and the whole process is repeated until the network converges to the solution.

Automatically computing gradients is called automatic differentiation, or autodiff. There are various autodiff techniques, with different pros and cons. The one used by backpropagation is called reverse-mode autodiff. It is fast and precise, and is well suited when the function to differentiate has many variables (e.g., connection weights) and few outputs (e.g., one loss). If you want to learn more about autodiff, check out Appendix D.

Let’s run through this algorithm in a bit more detail:
•	It handles one mini-batch at a time (for example, containing 32 instances each), and it goes through the full training set multiple times. Each pass is called an epoch.
•	Each mini-batch is passed to the network’s input layer, which sends it to the first hidden layer. The algorithm then computes the output of all the neurons in this layer (for every instance in the mini-batch). The result is passed on to the next layer, its output is computed and passed to the next layer, and so on until we get the output of the last layer, the output layer. This is the forward pass: it is exactly like making predictions, except all intermediate results are preserved since they are needed for the backward pass.
•	Next, the algorithm measures the network’s output error (i.e., it uses a loss function that compares the desired output and the actual output of the network, and returns some measure of the error).
•	Then it computes how much each output connection contributed to the error. This is done analytically by applying the chain rule (perhaps the most fundamental rule in calculus), which makes this step fast and precise.

11	David Rumelhart et al. “Learning Internal Representations by Error Propagation,” (Defense Technical Information Center technical report, September 1985).
12	This technique was actually independently invented several times by various researchers in different fields, starting with Paul Werbos in 1974.
 
•	The algorithm then measures how much of these error contributions came from each connection in the layer below, again using the chain rule, working backward until the algorithm reaches the input layer. As explained earlier, this reverse pass efficiently measures the error gradient across all the connection weights in the network by propagating the error gradient backward through the network (hence the name of the algorithm).
•	Finally, the algorithm performs a Gradient Descent step to tweak all the connection weights in the network, using the error gradients it just computed.
This algorithm is so important that it’s worth summarizing it again: for each training instance, the backpropagation algorithm first makes a prediction (forward pass) and measures the error, then goes through each layer in reverse to measure the error contribution from each connection (reverse pass), and finally tweaks the connection weights to reduce the error (Gradient Descent step).

It is important to initialize all the hidden layers’ connection weights randomly, or else training will fail. For example, if you initialize all weights and biases to zero, then all neurons in a given layer will be perfectly identical, and thus backpropagation will affect them in exactly the same way, so they will remain identical. In other words, despite having hundreds of neurons per layer, your model will act as if it had only one neuron per layer: it won’t be too smart. If instead you randomly initialize the weights, you break the symmetry and allow backpropagation to train a diverse team of neurons.

In order for this algorithm to work properly, its authors made a key change to the MLP’s architecture: they replaced the step function with the logistic (sigmoid) function, σ(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(–z)). This was essential because the step function contains only flat segments, so there is no gradient to work with (Gradient Descent cannot move on a flat surface), while the logistic function has a well-defined nonzero derivative everywhere, allowing Gradient Descent to make some progress at every step. In fact, the backpropagation algorithm works well with many other activation functions, not just the logistic function. Here are two other popular choices:
The hyperbolic tangent function: tanh(z) = 2σ(2z) – 1
Just like the logistic function, this activation function is S-shaped, continuous, and differentiable, but its output value ranges from –1 to 1 (instead of 0 to 1 in the case of the logistic function). That range tends to make each layer’s output more or less centered around 0 at the beginning of training, which often helps speed up convergence.
 
The Rectified Linear Unit function: ReLU(z) = max(0, z)
The ReLU function is continuous but unfortunately not differentiable at z = 0 (the slope changes abruptly, which can make Gradient Descent bounce around), and its derivative is 0 for z < 0. In practice, however, it works very well and has the advantage of being fast to compute, so it has become the default.13 Most importantly, the fact that it does not have a maximum output value helps reduce some issues during Gradient Descent (we will come back to this in Chapter 11).
These popular activation functions and their derivatives are represented in Figure 10-8. But wait! Why do we need activation functions in the first place? Well, if you chain several linear transformations, all you get is a linear transformation. For example, if f(x) = 2x + 3 and g(x) = 5x – 1, then chaining these two linear functions gives you another linear function: f(g(x)) = 2(5x – 1) + 3 = 10x + 1. So if you don’t have some nonlinearity between layers, then even a deep stack of layers is equivalent to a single layer, and you can’t solve very complex problems with that. Conversely, a large enough DNN with nonlinear activations can theoretically approximate any continuous function.

Figure 10-8. Activation functions and their derivatives
OK! You know where neural nets came from, what their architecture is, and how to compute their outputs. You’ve also learned about the backpropagation algorithm. But what exactly can you do with them?
Regression MLPs
First, MLPs can be used for regression tasks. If you want to predict a single value (e.g., the price of a house, given many of its features), then you just need a single output neuron: its output is the predicted value. For multivariate regression (i.e., to predict

13	Biological neurons seem to implement a roughly sigmoid (S-shaped) activation function, so researchers stuck to sigmoid functions for a very long time. But it turns out that ReLU generally works better in ANNs. This is one of the cases where the biological analogy was misleading.
 
multiple values at once), you need one output neuron per output dimension. For example, to locate the center of an object in an image, you need to predict 2D coordinates, so you need two output neurons. If you also want to place a bounding box around the object, then you need two more numbers: the width and the height of the object. So, you end up with four output neurons.
In general, when building an MLP for regression, you do not want to use any activation function for the output neurons, so they are free to output any range of values. If you want to guarantee that the output will always be positive, then you can use the ReLU activation function in the output layer. Alternatively, you can use the softplus activation function, which is a smooth variant of ReLU: softplus(z) = log(1 + exp(z)). It is close to 0 when z is negative, and close to z when z is positive. Finally, if you want to guarantee that the predictions will fall within a given range of values, then you can use the logistic function or the hyperbolic tangent, and then scale the labels to the appropriate range: 0 to 1 for the logistic function and –1 to 1 for the hyperbolic tangent.
The loss function to use during training is typically the mean squared error, but if you have a lot of outliers in the training set, you may prefer to use the mean absolute error instead. Alternatively, you can use the Huber loss, which is a combination of both.

The Huber loss is quadratic when the error is smaller than a threshold δ (typically 1) but linear when the error is larger than δ. The linear part makes it less sensitive to outliers than the mean squared error, and the quadratic part allows it to converge faster and be more precise than the mean absolute error.

Table 10-1 summarizes the typical architecture of a regression MLP.

# input neurons	One per input feature (e.g., 28 x 28 = 784 for MNIST) # hidden layers	Depends on the problem, but typically 1 to 5
# neurons per hidden layer Depends on the problem, but typically 10 to 100 # output neurons	1 per prediction dimension
Hidden activation	ReLU (or SELU, see Chapter 11)
Output activation	None, or ReLU/softplus (if positive outputs) or logistic/tanh (if bounded outputs) Loss function	MSE or MAE/Huber (if outliers)
 
 
Classification MLPs
MLPs can also be used for classification tasks. For a binary classification problem, you just need a single output neuron using the logistic activation function: the output will be a number between 0 and 1, which you can interpret as the estimated probability of the positive class. The estimated probability of the negative class is equal to one minus that number.
MLPs can also easily handle multilabel binary classification tasks (see Chapter 3). For example, you could have an email classification system that predicts whether each incoming email is ham or spam, and simultaneously predicts whether it is an urgent or nonurgent email. In this case, you would need two output neurons, both using the logistic activation function: the first would output the probability that the email is spam, and the second would output the probability that it is urgent. More generally, you would dedicate one output neuron for each positive class. Note that the output probabilities do not necessarily add up to 1. This lets the model output any combination of labels: you can have nonurgent ham, urgent ham, nonurgent spam, and perhaps even urgent spam (although that would probably be an error).
If each instance can belong only to a single class, out of three or more possible classes (e.g., classes 0 through 9 for digit image classification), then you need to have one output neuron per class, and you should use the softmax activation function for the whole output layer (see Figure 10-9). The softmax function (introduced in Chapter 4) will ensure that all the estimated probabilities are between 0 and 1 and that they add up to 1 (which is required if the classes are exclusive). This is called multiclass classification.

Figure 10-9. A modern MLP (including ReLU and softmax) for classification
 
Regarding the loss function, since we are predicting probability distributions, the cross-entropy loss (also called the log loss, see Chapter 4) is generally a good choice.
Table 10-2 summarizes the typical architecture of a classification MLP.

Before we go on, I recommend you go through exercise 1 at the end of this chapter. You will play with various neural network architectures and visualize their outputs using the TensorFlow Playground. This will be very useful to better understand MLPs, including the effects of all the hyperparameters (number of layers and neurons, activation functions, and more).

Now you have all the concepts you need to start implementing MLPs with Keras!
Implementing MLPs with Keras
Keras is a high-level Deep Learning API that allows you to easily build, train, evaluate, and execute all sorts of neural networks. Its documentation (or specification) is available at https://keras.io/. The reference implementation, also called Keras, was developed by François Chollet as part of a research project14 and was released as an open source project in March 2015. It quickly gained popularity, owing to its ease of use, flexibility, and beautiful design. To perform the heavy computations required by neural networks, this reference implementation relies on a computation backend. At present, you can choose from three popular open source Deep Learning libraries: TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK), and Theano. Therefore, to avoid any confusion, we will refer to this reference implementation as multibackend Keras.
Since late 2016, other implementations have been released. You can now run Keras on Apache MXNet, Apple’s Core ML, JavaScript or TypeScript (to run Keras code in a web browser), and PlaidML (which can run on all sorts of GPU devices, not just Nvidia). Moreover, TensorFlow itself now comes bundled with its own Keras implementation, tf.keras. It only supports TensorFlow as the backend, but it has the advantage of offering some very useful extra features (see Figure 10-10): for example, it supports

14	Project ONEIROS (Open-ended Neuro-Electronic Intelligent Robot Operating System).
 
TensorFlow’s Data API, which makes it easy to load and preprocess data efficiently. For this reason, we will use tf.keras in this book. However, in this chapter we will not use any of the TensorFlow-specific features, so the code should run fine on other Keras implementations as well (at least in Python), with only minor modifications, such as changing the imports.

Figure 10-10. Two implementations of the Keras API: multibackend Keras (left) and tf.keras (right)
The most popular Deep Learning library, after Keras and TensorFlow, is Facebook’s PyTorch library. The good news is that its API is quite similar to Keras’s (in part because both APIs were inspired by Scikit-Learn and Chainer), so once you know Keras, it is not difficult to switch to PyTorch, if you ever want to. PyTorch’s popularity grew exponentially in 2018, largely thanks to its simplicity and excellent documentation, which were not TensorFlow 1.x’s main strengths. However, TensorFlow 2 is arguably just as simple as PyTorch, as it has adopted Keras as its official high-level API and its developers have greatly simplified and cleaned up the rest of the API. The documentation has also been completely reorganized, and it is much easier to find what you need now. Similarly, PyTorch’s main weaknesses (e.g., limited portability and no computation graph analysis) have been largely addressed in PyTorch 1.0. Healthy competition is beneficial to everyone.
All right, it’s time to code! As tf.keras is bundled with TensorFlow, let’s start by installing TensorFlow.
Installing TensorFlow 2
Assuming you installed Jupyter and Scikit-Learn by following the installation instructions in Chapter 2, use pip to install TensorFlow. If you created an isolated environment using virtualenv, you first need to activate it:
 
$ cd $ML_PATH	# Your ML working directory (e.g., $HOME/ml)
$ source my_env/bin/activate # on Linux or macOS
$ .\my_env\Scripts\activate	# on Windows
Next, install TensorFlow 2 (if you are not using a virtualenv, you will need administrator rights, or to add the --user option):
$ python3 -m pip install -U tensorflow

For GPU support, at the time of this writing you need to install tensorflow-gpu instead of tensorflow, but the TensorFlow team is working on having a single library that will support both CPU- only and GPU-equipped systems. You will still need to install extra libraries for GPU support (see https://tensorflow.org/install for more details). We will look at GPUs in more depth in Chapter 19.

To test your installation, open a Python shell or a Jupyter notebook, then import TensorFlow and tf.keras and print their versions:
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> from tensorflow import keras
>>> tf. version  '2.0.0'
>>> keras. version  '2.2.4-tf'
The second version is the version of the Keras API implemented by tf.keras. Note that it ends with -tf, highlighting the fact that tf.keras implements the Keras API, plus some extra TensorFlow-specific features.
Now let’s use tf.keras! We’ll start by building a simple image classifier.
Building an Image Classifier Using the Sequential API
First, we need to load a dataset. In this chapter we will tackle Fashion MNIST, which is a drop-in replacement of MNIST (introduced in Chapter 3). It has the exact same format as MNIST (70,000 grayscale images of 28 × 28 pixels each, with 10 classes), but the images represent fashion items rather than handwritten digits, so each class is more diverse, and the problem turns out to be significantly more challenging than MNIST. For example, a simple linear model reaches about 92% accuracy on MNIST, but only about 83% on Fashion MNIST.
Using Keras to load the dataset
Keras provides some utility functions to fetch and load common datasets, including MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and the California housing dataset we used in Chapter 2. Let’s load Fashion MNIST:
 
fashion_mnist = keras.datasets.fashion_mnist
(X_train_full, y_train_full), (X_test, y_test) = fashion_mnist.load_data()
When loading MNIST or Fashion MNIST using Keras rather than Scikit-Learn, one important difference is that every image is represented as a 28 × 28 array rather than a 1D array of size 784. Moreover, the pixel intensities are represented as integers (from 0 to 255) rather than floats (from 0.0 to 255.0). Let’s take a look at the shape and data type of the training set:
>>> X_train_full.shape (60000, 28, 28)
>>> X_train_full.dtype dtype('uint8')
Note that the dataset is already split into a training set and a test set, but there is no validation set, so we’ll create one now. Additionally, since we are going to train the neural network using Gradient Descent, we must scale the input features. For simplicity, we’ll scale the pixel intensities down to the 0–1 range by dividing them by 255.0 (this also converts them to floats):
X_valid, X_train = X_train_full[:5000] / 255.0, X_train_full[5000:] / 255.0 y_valid, y_train = y_train_full[:5000], y_train_full[5000:]
X_test = X_test / 255.0
With MNIST, when the label is equal to 5, it means that the image represents the handwritten digit 5. Easy. For Fashion MNIST, however, we need the list of class names to know what we are dealing with:
class_names = ["T-shirt/top", "Trouser", "Pullover", "Dress", "Coat", "Sandal", "Shirt", "Sneaker", "Bag", "Ankle boot"]
For example, the first image in the training set represents a coat:
>>> class_names[y_train[0]] 'Coat'
Figure 10-11 shows some samples from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

Figure 10-11. Samples from Fashion MNIST
 
Creating the model using the Sequential API
Now let’s build the neural network! Here is a classification MLP with two hidden layers:
model = keras.models.Sequential() model.add(keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=[28, 28])) model.add(keras.layers.Dense(300, activation="relu")) model.add(keras.layers.Dense(100, activation="relu")) model.add(keras.layers.Dense(10, activation="softmax"))
Let’s go through this code line by line:
•	The first line creates a Sequential model. This is the simplest kind of Keras model for neural networks that are just composed of a single stack of layers connected sequentially. This is called the Sequential API.
•	Next, we build the first layer and add it to the model. It is a Flatten layer whose role is to convert each input image into a 1D array: if it receives input data X, it computes X.reshape(-1, 28*28). This layer does not have any parameters; it is just there to do some simple preprocessing. Since it is the first layer in the model, you should specify the input_shape, which doesn’t include the batch size, only the shape of the instances. Alternatively, you could add a keras.layers.Input Layer as the first layer, setting input_shape=[28,28].
•	Next we add a Dense hidden layer with 300 neurons. It will use the ReLU activation function. Each Dense layer manages its own weight matrix, containing all the connection weights between the neurons and their inputs. It also manages a vector of bias terms (one per neuron). When it receives some input data, it computes Equation 10-2.
•	Then we add a second Dense hidden layer with 100 neurons, also using the ReLU activation function.
•	Finally, we add a Dense output layer with 10 neurons (one per class), using the softmax activation function (because the classes are exclusive).

Specifying activation="relu" is equivalent to specifying activa tion=keras.activations.relu. Other activation functions are available in the keras.activations package, we will use many of them in this book. See https://keras.io/activations/ for the full list.

Instead of adding the layers one by one as we just did, you can pass a list of layers when creating the Sequential model:
 
model = keras.models.Sequential([ keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=[28, 28]), keras.layers.Dense(300, activation="relu"), keras.layers.Dense(100, activation="relu"), keras.layers.Dense(10, activation="softmax")
])

The model’s summary() method displays all the model’s layers,15 including each layer’s name (which is automatically generated unless you set it when creating the layer), its output shape (None means the batch size can be anything), and its number of parameters. The summary ends with the total number of parameters, including trainable and non-trainable parameters. Here we only have trainable parameters (we will see examples of non-trainable parameters in Chapter 11):
>>> model.summary() Model: "sequential"

Layer (type)	Output Shape	Param #
=================================================================
flatten (Flatten)	(None, 784)	0
dense (Dense)	(None, 300)	235500


15	You can use keras.utils.plot_model() to generate an image of your model.
 
dense_1 (Dense)	(None, 100)	30100

dense_2 (Dense)	(None, 10)	1010
=================================================================
Total params: 266,610
Trainable params: 266,610
Non-trainable params: 0

Note that Dense layers often have a lot of parameters. For example, the first hidden layer has 784 × 300 connection weights, plus 300 bias terms, which adds up to 235,500 parameters! This gives the model quite a lot of flexibility to fit the training data, but it also means that the model runs the risk of overfitting, especially when you do not have a lot of training data. We will come back to this later.
You can easily get a model’s list of layers, to fetch a layer by its index, or you can fetch it by name:
>>> model.layers
[<tensorflow.python.keras.layers.core.Flatten at 0x132414e48>,
<tensorflow.python.keras.layers.core.Dense at 0x1324149b0>,
<tensorflow.python.keras.layers.core.Dense at 0x1356ba8d0>,
<tensorflow.python.keras.layers.core.Dense at 0x13240d240>]
>>> hidden1 = model.layers[1]
>>> hidden1.name 'dense'
>>> model.get_layer('dense') is hidden1 True
All the parameters of a layer can be accessed using its get_weights() and set_weights() methods. For a Dense layer, this includes both the connection weights and the bias terms:
>>> weights, biases = hidden1.get_weights()
>>> weights
array([[ 0.02448617, -0.00877795, -0.02189048, ..., -0.02766046,
0.03859074, -0.06889391],
...,
[-0.06022581, 0.01577859, -0.02585464, ..., -0.00527829,
0.00272203, -0.06793761]], dtype=float32)
>>> weights.shape (784, 300)
>>> biases
array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.], dtype=float32)
>>> biases.shape (300,)
Notice that the Dense layer initialized the connection weights randomly (which is needed to break symmetry, as we discussed earlier), and the biases were initialized to zeros, which is fine. If you ever want to use a different initialization method, you can set kernel_initializer (kernel is another name for the matrix of connection
 
weights) or bias_initializer when creating the layer. We will discuss initializers further in Chapter 11, but if you want the full list, see https://keras.io/initializers/.

The shape of the weight matrix depends on the number of inputs. This is why it is recommended to specify the input_shape when creating the first layer in a Sequential model. However, if you do not specify the input shape, it’s OK: Keras will simply wait until it knows the input shape before it actually builds the model. This will happen either when you feed it actual data (e.g., during training), or when you call its build() method. Until the model is really built, the layers will not have any weights, and you will not be able to do certain things (such as print the model summary or save the model). So, if you know the input shape when creating the model, it is best to specify it.
Compiling the model
After a model is created, you must call its compile() method to specify the loss function and the optimizer to use. Optionally, you can specify a list of extra metrics to compute during training and evaluation:
model.compile(loss="sparse_categorical_crossentropy", optimizer="sgd",
metrics=["accuracy"])

Using loss="sparse_categorical_crossentropy" is equivalent to using	loss=keras.losses.sparse_categorical_crossentropy. Similarly, specifying optimizer="sgd" is equivalent to specifying optimizer=keras.optimizers.SGD(), and metrics=["accuracy"] is equivalent to metrics=[keras.metrics.sparse_categori cal_accuracy] (when using this loss). We will use many other losses, optimizers, and metrics in this book; for the full lists, see https://keras.io/losses,	https://keras.io/optimizers,	and	https:// keras.io/metrics.

This code requires some explanation. First, we use the "sparse_categorical_cross entropy" loss because we have sparse labels (i.e., for each instance, there is just a target class index, from 0 to 9 in this case), and the classes are exclusive. If instead we had one target probability per class for each instance (such as one-hot vectors, e.g. [0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.] to represent class 3), then we would need to use the "categorical_crossentropy" loss instead. If we were doing binary classification or multilabel binary classification, then we would use the "sigmoid" (i.e., logistic) activation function in the output layer instead of the "softmax" activation function, and we would use the "binary_crossentropy" loss.
 
If you want to convert sparse labels (i.e., class indices) to one-hot vector labels, use the keras.utils.to_categorical() function. To go the other way round, use the np.argmax() function with axis=1.

Regarding the optimizer, "sgd" means that we will train the model using simple Stochastic Gradient Descent. In other words, Keras will perform the backpropagation algorithm described earlier (i.e., reverse-mode autodiff plus Gradient Descent). We will discuss more efficient optimizers in Chapter 11 (they improve the Gradient Descent part, not the autodiff).

When using the SGD optimizer, it is important to tune the learning rate. So, you will generally want to use optimizer=keras.optimiz ers.SGD(lr=???) to set the learning rate, rather than opti mizer="sgd", which defaults to lr=0.01.

Finally, since this is a classifier, it’s useful to measure its "accuracy" during training and evaluation.
Training and evaluating the model
Now the model is ready to be trained. For this we simply need to call its fit()
method:
>>> history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=30,
...	validation_data=(X_valid, y_valid))
...
Train on 55000 samples, validate on 5000 samples Epoch 1/30
55000/55000 [======] - 3s 49us/sample - loss: 0.7218	- accuracy: 0.7660
-	val_loss: 0.4973 - val_accuracy: 0.8366
Epoch 2/30
55000/55000 [======] - 2s 45us/sample - loss: 0.4840	- accuracy: 0.8327
-	val_loss: 0.4456 - val_accuracy: 0.8480
[...]
Epoch 30/30
55000/55000 [======] - 3s 53us/sample - loss: 0.2252	- accuracy: 0.9192
-	val_loss: 0.2999 - val_accuracy: 0.8926
We pass it the input features (X_train) and the target classes (y_train), as well as the number of epochs to train (or else it would default to just 1, which would definitely not be enough to converge to a good solution). We also pass a validation set (this is optional). Keras will measure the loss and the extra metrics on this set at the end of each epoch, which is very useful to see how well the model really performs. If the performance on the training set is much better than on the validation set, your model is
 
probably overfitting the training set (or there is a bug, such as a data mismatch between the training set and the validation set).
And that’s it! The neural network is trained.16 At each epoch during training, Keras displays the number of instances processed so far (along with a progress bar), the mean training time per sample, and the loss and accuracy (or any other extra metrics you asked for) on both the training set and the validation set. You can see that the training loss went down, which is a good sign, and the validation accuracy reached 89.26% after 30 epochs. That’s not too far from the training accuracy, so there does not seem to be much overfitting going on.

Instead of passing a validation set using the validation_data argument, you could set validation_split to the ratio of the training set that you want Keras to use for validation. For example, validation_split=0.1 tells Keras to use the last 10% of the data (before shuffling) for validation.

If the training set was very skewed, with some classes being overrepresented and others underrepresented, it would be useful to set the class_weight argument when calling the fit() method, which would give a larger weight to underrepresented classes and a lower weight to overrepresented classes. These weights would be used by Keras when computing the loss. If you need per-instance weights, set the sam ple_weight argument (if both class_weight and sample_weight are provided, Keras multiplies them). Per-instance weights could be useful if some instances were labeled by experts while others were labeled using a crowdsourcing platform: you might want to give more weight to the former. You can also provide sample weights (but not class weights) for the validation set by adding them as a third item in the validation_data tuple.
The fit() method returns a History object containing the training parameters (history.params), the list of epochs it went through (history.epoch), and most importantly a dictionary (history.history) containing the loss and extra metrics it measured at the end of each epoch on the training set and on the validation set (if any). If you use this dictionary to create a pandas DataFrame and call its plot() method, you get the learning curves shown in Figure 10-12:



16	If your training or validation data does not match the expected shape, you will get an exception. This is perhaps the most common error, so you should get familiar with the error message. The message is actually quite clear: for example, if you try to train this model with an array containing flattened images (X_train.reshape(-1, 784)), then you will get the following exception: “ValueError: Error when checking input: expected flatten_input to have 3 dimensions, but got array with shape (60000, 784).”
 
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
pd.DataFrame(history.history).plot(figsize=(8, 5)) plt.grid(True)
plt.gca().set_ylim(0, 1) # set the vertical range to [0-1]
plt.show()

Figure 10-12. Learning curves: the mean training loss and accuracy measured over each epoch, and the mean validation loss and accuracy measured at the end of each epoch
You can see that both the training accuracy and the validation accuracy steadily increase during training, while the training loss and the validation loss decrease. Good! Moreover, the validation curves are close to the training curves, which means that there is not too much overfitting. In this particular case, the model looks like it performed better on the validation set than on the training set at the beginning of training. But that’s not the case: indeed, the validation error is computed at the end of each epoch, while the training error is computed using a running mean during each epoch. So the training curve should be shifted by half an epoch to the left. If you do that, you will see that the training and validation curves overlap almost perfectly at the beginning of training.

When plotting the training curve, it should be shifted by half an epoch to the left.
 
The training set performance ends up beating the validation performance, as is generally the case when you train for long enough. You can tell that the model has not quite converged yet, as the validation loss is still going down, so you should probably continue training. It’s as simple as calling the fit() method again, since Keras just continues training where it left off (you should be able to reach close to 89.4% validation accuracy).
If you are not satisfied with the performance of your model, you should go back and tune the hyperparameters. The first one to check is the learning rate. If that doesn’t help, try another optimizer (and always retune the learning rate after changing any hyperparameter). If the performance is still not great, then try tuning model hyperparameters such as the number of layers, the number of neurons per layer, and the types of activation functions to use for each hidden layer. You can also try tuning other hyperparameters, such as the batch size (it can be set in the fit() method using the batch_size argument, which defaults to 32). We will get back to hyperparameter tuning at the end of this chapter. Once you are satisfied with your model’s validation accuracy, you should evaluate it on the test set to estimate the generalization error before you deploy the model to production. You can easily do this using the evalu ate() method (it also supports several other arguments, such as batch_size and sample_weight; please check the documentation for more details):
>>> model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
10000/10000 [==========] - 0s 29us/sample - loss: 0.3340 - accuracy: 0.8851 [0.3339798209667206, 0.8851]
As we saw in Chapter 2, it is common to get slightly lower performance on the test set than on the validation set, because the hyperparameters are tuned on the validation set, not the test set (however, in this example, we did not do any hyperparameter tuning, so the lower accuracy is just bad luck). Remember to resist the temptation to tweak the hyperparameters on the test set, or else your estimate of the generalization error will be too optimistic.
Using the model to make predictions
Next, we can use the model’s predict() method to make predictions on new instances. Since we don’t have actual new instances, we will just use the first three instances of the test set:
>>> X_new = X_test[:3]
>>> y_proba = model.predict(X_new)
>>> y_proba.round(2)
array([[0.	, 0.	, 0. , 0.	, 0. , 0.03, 0.	, 0.01, 0.	, 0.96],
[0.	, 0.	, 0.98, 0.	, 0.02, 0. , 0.	, 0. , 0.	, 0. ],
[0.	, 1.	, 0. , 0.	, 0. , 0. , 0.	, 0. , 0.	, 0. ]],
dtype=float32)
 
As you can see, for each instance the model estimates one probability per class, from class 0 to class 9. For example, for the first image it estimates that the probability of class 9 (ankle boot) is 96%, the probability of class 5 (sandal) is 3%, the probability of class 7 (sneaker) is 1%, and the probabilities of the other classes are negligible. In other words, it “believes” the first image is footwear, most likely ankle boots but possibly sandals or sneakers. If you only care about the class with the highest estimated probability (even if that probability is quite low), then you can use the pre dict_classes() method instead:
>>> y_pred = model.predict_classes(X_new)
>>> y_pred array([9, 2, 1])
>>> np.array(class_names)[y_pred]
array(['Ankle boot', 'Pullover', 'Trouser'], dtype='<U11')
Here, the classifier actually classified all three images correctly (these images are shown in Figure 10-13):
>>> y_new = y_test[:3]
>>> y_new array([9, 2, 1])

Figure 10-13. Correctly classified Fashion MNIST images
Now you know how to use the Sequential API to build, train, evaluate, and use a classification MLP. But what about regression?
Building a Regression MLP Using the Sequential API
Let’s switch to the California housing problem and tackle it using a regression neural network. For simplicity, we will use Scikit-Learn’s fetch_california_housing() function to load the data. This dataset is simpler than the one we used in Chapter 2, since it contains only numerical features (there is no ocean_proximity feature), and there is no missing value. After loading the data, we split it into a training set, a validation set, and a test set, and we scale all the features:
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
 
housing = fetch_california_housing()
X_train_full, X_test, y_train_full, y_test = train_test_split( housing.data, housing.target)
X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split( X_train_full, y_train_full)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train) X_valid = scaler.transform(X_valid) X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
Using the Sequential API to build, train, evaluate, and use a regression MLP to make predictions is quite similar to what we did for classification. The main differences are the fact that the output layer has a single neuron (since we only want to predict a single value) and uses no activation function, and the loss function is the mean squared error. Since the dataset is quite noisy, we just use a single hidden layer with fewer neurons than before, to avoid overfitting:
model = keras.models.Sequential([
keras.layers.Dense(30, activation="relu", input_shape=X_train.shape[1:]), keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model.compile(loss="mean_squared_error", optimizer="sgd") history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20,
validation_data=(X_valid, y_valid)) mse_test = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
X_new = X_test[:3] # pretend these are new instances
y_pred = model.predict(X_new)
As you can see, the Sequential API is quite easy to use. However, although Sequen tial models are extremely common, it is sometimes useful to build neural networks with more complex topologies, or with multiple inputs or outputs. For this purpose, Keras offers the Functional API.
Building Complex Models Using the Functional API
One example of a nonsequential neural network is a Wide & Deep neural network. This neural network architecture was introduced in a 2016 paper by Heng-Tze Cheng et al.17 It connects all or part of the inputs directly to the output layer, as shown in Figure 10-14. This architecture makes it possible for the neural network to learn both deep patterns (using the deep path) and simple rules (through the short path).18 In contrast, a regular MLP forces all the data to flow through the full stack of layers;

17	Heng-Tze Cheng et al., “Wide & Deep Learning for Recommender Systems,” Proceedings of the First Workshop on Deep Learning for Recommender Systems (2016): 7–10.
18	The short path can also be used to provide manually engineered features to the neural network.
 
thus, simple patterns in the data may end up being distorted by this sequence of transformations.

Figure 10-14. Wide & Deep neural network
Let’s build such a neural network to tackle the California housing problem:
input_ = keras.layers.Input(shape=X_train.shape[1:]) hidden1 = keras.layers.Dense(30, activation="relu")(input_)
hidden2 = keras.layers.Dense(30, activation="relu")(hidden1) concat = keras.layers.Concatenate()([input_, hidden2]) output = keras.layers.Dense(1)(concat)
model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_], outputs=[output])
Let’s go through each line of this code:
•	First, we need to create an Input object.19 This is a specification of the kind of input the model will get, including its shape and dtype. A model may actually have multiple inputs, as we will see shortly.
•	Next, we create a Dense layer with 30 neurons, using the ReLU activation function. As soon as it is created, notice that we call it like a function, passing it the input. This is why this is called the Functional API. Note that we are just telling Keras how it should connect the layers together; no actual data is being processed yet.
•	We then create a second hidden layer, and again we use it as a function. Note that we pass it the output of the first hidden layer.



19	The name input_ is used to avoid overshadowing Python’s built-in input() function.
 
•	Next, we create a Concatenate layer, and once again we immediately use it like a function, to concatenate the input and the output of the second hidden layer. You may prefer the keras.layers.concatenate() function, which creates a Concatenate layer and immediately calls it with the given inputs.
•	Then we create the output layer, with a single neuron and no activation function, and we call it like a function, passing it the result of the concatenation.
•	Lastly, we create a Keras Model, specifying which inputs and outputs to use.
Once you have built the Keras model, everything is exactly like earlier, so there’s no need to repeat it here: you must compile the model, train it, evaluate it, and use it to make predictions.
But what if you want to send a subset of the features through the wide path and a different subset (possibly overlapping) through the deep path (see Figure 10-15)? In this case, one solution is to use multiple inputs. For example, suppose we want to send five features through the wide path (features 0 to 4), and six features through the deep path (features 2 to 7):
input_A = keras.layers.Input(shape=[5], name="wide_input") input_B = keras.layers.Input(shape=[6], name="deep_input") hidden1 = keras.layers.Dense(30, activation="relu")(input_B) hidden2 = keras.layers.Dense(30, activation="relu")(hidden1) concat = keras.layers.concatenate([input_A, hidden2])
output = keras.layers.Dense(1, name="output")(concat)
model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_A, input_B], outputs=[output])

Figure 10-15. Handling multiple inputs
 
The code is self-explanatory. You should name at least the most important layers, especially when the model gets a bit complex like this. Note that we specified inputs=[input_A, input_B] when creating the model. Now we can compile the model as usual, but when we call the fit() method, instead of passing a single input matrix X_train, we must pass a pair of matrices (X_train_A, X_train_B): one per input.20 The same is true for X_valid, and also for X_test and X_new when you call evaluate() or predict():
model.compile(loss="mse", optimizer=keras.optimizers.SGD(lr=1e-3))
X_train_A, X_train_B = X_train[:, :5], X_train[:, 2:] X_valid_A, X_valid_B = X_valid[:, :5], X_valid[:, 2:] X_test_A, X_test_B = X_test[:, :5], X_test[:, 2:] X_new_A, X_new_B = X_test_A[:3], X_test_B[:3]
history = model.fit((X_train_A, X_train_B), y_train, epochs=20,
validation_data=((X_valid_A, X_valid_B), y_valid)) mse_test = model.evaluate((X_test_A, X_test_B), y_test)
y_pred = model.predict((X_new_A, X_new_B))
There are many use cases in which you may want to have multiple outputs:
•	The task may demand it. For instance, you may want to locate and classify the main object in a picture. This is both a regression task (finding the coordinates of the object’s center, as well as its width and height) and a classification task.
•	Similarly, you may have multiple independent tasks based on the same data. Sure, you could train one neural network per task, but in many cases you will get better results on all tasks by training a single neural network with one output per task. This is because the neural network can learn features in the data that are useful across tasks. For example, you could perform multitask classification on pictures of faces, using one output to classify the person’s facial expression (smiling, surprised, etc.) and another output to identify whether they are wearing glasses or not.
•	Another use case is as a regularization technique (i.e., a training constraint whose objective is to reduce overfitting and thus improve the model’s ability to generalize). For example, you may want to add some auxiliary outputs in a neural network architecture (see Figure 10-16) to ensure that the underlying part of the network learns something useful on its own, without relying on the rest of the network.


20	Alternatively, you can pass a dictionary mapping the input names to the input values, like {"wide_input": X_train_A, "deep_input": X_train_B}. This is especially useful when there are many inputs, to avoid getting the order wrong.
 
 
Figure 10-16. Handling multiple outputs, in this example to add an auxiliary output for regularization
Adding extra outputs is quite easy: just connect them to the appropriate layers and add them to your model’s list of outputs. For example, the following code builds the network represented in Figure 10-16:
[...] # Same as above, up to the main output layer
output = keras.layers.Dense(1, name="main_output")(concat) aux_output = keras.layers.Dense(1, name="aux_output")(hidden2)
model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_A, input_B], outputs=[output, aux_output])
Each output will need its own loss function. Therefore, when we compile the model, we should pass a list of losses21 (if we pass a single loss, Keras will assume that the same loss must be used for all outputs). By default, Keras will compute all these losses and simply add them up to get the final loss used for training. We care much more about the main output than about the auxiliary output (as it is just used for regularization), so we want to give the main output’s loss a much greater weight. Fortunately, it is possible to set all the loss weights when compiling the model:
model.compile(loss=["mse", "mse"], loss_weights=[0.9, 0.1], optimizer="sgd")
Now when we train the model, we need to provide labels for each output. In this example, the main output and the auxiliary output should try to predict the same thing, so they should use the same labels. So instead of passing y_train, we need to pass (y_train, y_train) (and the same goes for y_valid and y_test):
history = model.fit(
[X_train_A, X_train_B], [y_train, y_train], epochs=20, validation_data=([X_valid_A, X_valid_B], [y_valid, y_valid]))


21	Alternatively, you can pass a dictionary that maps each output name to the corresponding loss. Just like for the inputs, this is useful when there are multiple outputs, to avoid getting the order wrong. The loss weights and metrics (discussed shortly) can also be set using dictionaries.
 
When we evaluate the model, Keras will return the total loss, as well as all the individual losses:
total_loss, main_loss, aux_loss = model.evaluate( [X_test_A, X_test_B], [y_test, y_test])
Similarly, the predict() method will return predictions for each output:
y_pred_main, y_pred_aux = model.predict([X_new_A, X_new_B])
As you can see, you can build any sort of architecture you want quite easily with the Functional API. Let’s look at one last way you can build Keras models.
Using the Subclassing API to Build Dynamic Models
Both the Sequential API and the Functional API are declarative: you start by declaring which layers you want to use and how they should be connected, and only then can you start feeding the model some data for training or inference. This has many advantages: the model can easily be saved, cloned, and shared; its structure can be displayed and analyzed; the framework can infer shapes and check types, so errors can be caught early (i.e., before any data ever goes through the model). It’s also fairly easy to debug, since the whole model is a static graph of layers. But the flip side is just that: it’s static. Some models involve loops, varying shapes, conditional branching, and other dynamic behaviors. For such cases, or simply if you prefer a more imperative programming style, the Subclassing API is for you.
Simply subclass the Model class, create the layers you need in the constructor, and use them to perform the computations you want in the call() method. For example, creating an instance of the following WideAndDeepModel class gives us an equivalent model to the one we just built with the Functional API. You can then compile it, evaluate it, and use it to make predictions, exactly like we just did:
class WideAndDeepModel(keras.Model):
def __init__(self, units=30, activation="relu", **kwargs): super().__init__(**kwargs) # handles standard args (e.g., name) self.hidden1 = keras.layers.Dense(units, activation=activation) self.hidden2 = keras.layers.Dense(units, activation=activation) self.main_output = keras.layers.Dense(1)
self.aux_output = keras.layers.Dense(1)
def call(self, inputs): input_A, input_B = inputs
hidden1 = self.hidden1(input_B) hidden2 = self.hidden2(hidden1)
concat = keras.layers.concatenate([input_A, hidden2]) main_output = self.main_output(concat)
aux_output = self.aux_output(hidden2)
return main_output, aux_output model = WideAndDeepModel()
 
This example looks very much like the Functional API, except we do not need to create the inputs; we just use the input argument to the call() method, and we separate the creation of the layers22 in the constructor from their usage in the call() method. The big difference is that you can do pretty much anything you want in the call() method: for loops, if statements, low-level TensorFlow operations—your imagination is the limit (see Chapter 12)! This makes it a great API for researchers experimenting with new ideas.
This extra flexibility does come at a cost: your model’s architecture is hidden within the call() method, so Keras cannot easily inspect it; it cannot save or clone it; and when you call the summary() method, you only get a list of layers, without any information on how they are connected to each other. Moreover, Keras cannot check types and shapes ahead of time, and it is easier to make mistakes. So unless you really need that extra flexibility, you should probably stick to the Sequential API or the Functional API.

Keras models can be used just like regular layers, so you can easily combine them to build complex architectures.



Now that you know how to build and train neural nets using Keras, you will want to save them!
Saving and Restoring a Model
When using the Sequential API or the Functional API, saving a trained Keras model is as simple as it gets:
model = keras.models.Sequential([...]) # or keras.Model([...])
model.compile([...])
model.fit([...]) model.save("my_keras_model.h5")
Keras will use the HDF5 format to save both the model’s architecture (including every layer’s hyperparameters) and the values of all the model parameters for every layer (e.g., connection weights and biases). It also saves the optimizer (including its hyperparameters and any state it may have). In Chapter 19, we will see how to save a tf.keras model using TensorFlow’s SavedModel format instead.



22	Keras models have an output attribute, so we cannot use that name for the main output layer, which is why we renamed it to main_output.
 
You will typically have a script that trains a model and saves it, and one or more scripts (or web services) that load the model and use it to make predictions. Loading the model is just as easy:
model = keras.models.load_model("my_keras_model.h5")

This will work when using the Sequential API or the Functional API, but unfortunately not when using model subclassing. You can use save_weights() and load_weights() to at least save and restore the model parameters, but you will need to save and restore everything else yourself.

But what if training lasts several hours? This is quite common, especially when training on large datasets. In this case, you should not only save your model at the end of training, but also save checkpoints at regular intervals during training, to avoid losing everything if your computer crashes. But how can you tell the fit() method to save checkpoints? Use callbacks.
Using Callbacks
The fit() method accepts a callbacks argument that lets you specify a list of objects that Keras will call at the start and end of training, at the start and end of each epoch, and even before and after processing each batch. For example, the ModelCheckpoint callback saves checkpoints of your model at regular intervals during training, by default at the end of each epoch:
[...] # build and compile the model
checkpoint_cb = keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint("my_keras_model.h5") history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[checkpoint_cb])
Moreover, if you use a validation set during training, you can set save_best_only=True when creating the ModelCheckpoint. In this case, it will only save your model when its performance on the validation set is the best so far. This way, you do not need to worry about training for too long and overfitting the training set: simply restore the last model saved after training, and this will be the best model on the validation set. The following code is a simple way to implement early stopping (introduced in Chapter 4):
checkpoint_cb = keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint("my_keras_model.h5",
save_best_only=True) history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10,
validation_data=(X_valid, y_valid), callbacks=[checkpoint_cb])
model = keras.models.load_model("my_keras_model.h5") # roll back to best model
Another way to implement early stopping is to simply use the EarlyStopping callback. It will interrupt training when it measures no progress on the validation set for
 
a number of epochs (defined by the patience argument), and it will optionally roll back to the best model. You can combine both callbacks to save checkpoints of your model (in case your computer crashes) and interrupt training early when there is no more progress (to avoid wasting time and resources):
early_stopping_cb = keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(patience=10,
restore_best_weights=True)
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100,
validation_data=(X_valid, y_valid), callbacks=[checkpoint_cb, early_stopping_cb])
The number of epochs can be set to a large value since training will stop automatically when there is no more progress. In this case, there is no need to restore the best model saved because the EarlyStopping callback will keep track of the best weights and restore them for you at the end of training.

There are many other callbacks available in the keras.callbacks
package.



If you need extra control, you can easily write your own custom callbacks. As an example of how to do that, the following custom callback will display the ratio between the validation loss and the training loss during training (e.g., to detect overfitting):
class PrintValTrainRatioCallback(keras.callbacks.Callback): def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs):
print("\nval/train: {:.2f}".format(logs["val_loss"] / logs["loss"]))
As you might expect, you can implement on_train_begin(), on_train_end(), on_epoch_begin(), on_epoch_end(), on_batch_begin(), and on_batch_end(). Callbacks can also be used during evaluation and predictions, should you ever need them (e.g., for debugging). For evaluation, you should implement on_test_begin(), on_test_end(), on_test_batch_begin(), or on_test_batch_end() (called by evalu ate()), and for prediction you should implement on_predict_begin(), on_pre dict_end(), on_predict_batch_begin(), or on_predict_batch_end() (called by predict()).
Now let’s take a look at one more tool you should definitely have in your toolbox when using tf.keras: TensorBoard.
 
Using TensorBoard for Visualization
TensorBoard is a great interactive visualization tool that you can use to view the learning curves during training, compare learning curves between multiple runs, visualize the computation graph, analyze training statistics, view images generated by your model, visualize complex multidimensional data projected down to 3D and automatically clustered for you, and more! This tool is installed automatically when you install TensorFlow, so you already have it.
To use it, you must modify your program so that it outputs the data you want to visualize to special binary log files called event files. Each binary data record is called a summary. The TensorBoard server will monitor the log directory, and it will automatically pick up the changes and update the visualizations: this allows you to visualize live data (with a short delay), such as the learning curves during training. In general, you want to point the TensorBoard server to a root log directory and configure your program so that it writes to a different subdirectory every time it runs. This way, the same TensorBoard server instance will allow you to visualize and compare data from multiple runs of your program, without getting everything mixed up.
Let’s start by defining the root log directory we will use for our TensorBoard logs, plus a small function that will generate a subdirectory path based on the current date and time so that it’s different at every run. You may want to include extra information in the log directory name, such as hyperparameter values that you are testing, to make it easier to know what you are looking at in TensorBoard:
import os
root_logdir = os.path.join(os.curdir, "my_logs")
def get_run_logdir():
import time
run_id = time.strftime("run_%Y_%m_%d-%H_%M_%S")
return os.path.join(root_logdir, run_id)
run_logdir = get_run_logdir() # e.g., './my_logs/run_2019_06_07-15_15_22'
The good news is that Keras provides a nice TensorBoard() callback:
[...] # Build and compile your model
tensorboard_cb = keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(run_logdir) history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=30,
validation_data=(X_valid, y_valid), callbacks=[tensorboard_cb])
And that’s all there is to it! It could hardly be easier to use. If you run this code, the TensorBoard() callback will take care of creating the log directory for you (along with its parent directories if needed), and during training it will create event files and write summaries to them. After running the program a second time (perhaps
 
changing some hyperparameter value), you will end up with a directory structure similar to this one:
my_logs/
├── run_2019_06_07-15_15_22
│	├── train
│	│	├──   events.out.tfevents.1559891732.mycomputer.local.38511.694049.v2
│	│	├──  events.out.tfevents.1559891732.mycomputer.local.profile-empty
│	│	└── plugins/profile/2019-06-07_15-15-32
│	│	└── local.trace
│	└── validation
│	└──   events.out.tfevents.1559891733.mycomputer.local.38511.696430.v2
└── run_2019_06_07-15_15_49
└── [...]
There’s one directory per run, each containing one subdirectory for training logs and one for validation logs. Both contain event files, but the training logs also include profiling traces: this allows TensorBoard to show you exactly how much time the model spent on each part of your model, across all your devices, which is great for locating performance bottlenecks.
Next you need to start the TensorBoard server. One way to do this is by running a command in a terminal. If you installed TensorFlow within a virtualenv, you should activate it. Next, run the following command at the root of the project (or from anywhere else, as long as you point to the appropriate log directory):
$ tensorboard --logdir=./my_logs --port=6006
TensorBoard 2.0.0 at http://mycomputer.local:6006/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
If your shell cannot find the tensorboard script, then you must update your PATH environment variable so that it contains the directory in which the script was installed (alternatively, you can just replace tensorboard in the command line with python3
-m tensorboard.main). Once the server is up, you can open a web browser and go to
http://localhost:6006.
Alternatively, you can use TensorBoard directly within Jupyter, by running the following commands. The first line loads the TensorBoard extension, and the second line starts a TensorBoard server on port 6006 (unless it is already started) and connects to it:
%load_ext tensorboard
%tensorboard --logdir=./my_logs --port=6006
Either way, you should see TensorBoard’s web interface. Click the SCALARS tab to view the learning curves (see Figure 10-17). At the bottom left, select the logs you want to visualize (e.g., the training logs from the first and second run), and click the epoch_loss scalar. Notice that the training loss went down nicely during both runs, but the second run went down much faster. Indeed, we used a learning rate of 0.05 (optimizer=keras.optimizers.SGD(lr=0.05)) instead of 0.001.
 
 
Figure 10-17. Visualizing learning curves with TensorBoard
You can also visualize the whole graph, the learned weights (projected to 3D), or the profiling traces. The TensorBoard() callback has options to log extra data too, such as embeddings (see Chapter 13).
Additionally, TensorFlow offers a lower-level API in the tf.summary package. The following code creates a SummaryWriter using the create_file_writer() function, and it uses this writer as a context to log scalars, histograms, images, audio, and text, all of which can then be visualized using TensorBoard (give it a try!):
test_logdir = get_run_logdir()
writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(test_logdir)
with writer.as_default():
for step in range(1, 1000 + 1):
tf.summary.scalar("my_scalar", np.sin(step / 10), step=step)
data = (np.random.randn(100) + 2) * step / 100 # some random data tf.summary.histogram("my_hist", data, buckets=50, step=step) images = np.random.rand(2, 32, 32, 3) # random 32×32 RGB images tf.summary.image("my_images", images * step / 1000, step=step)
texts = ["The step is " + str(step), "Its square is " + str(step**2)] tf.summary.text("my_text", texts, step=step)
sine_wave = tf.math.sin(tf.range(12000) / 48000 * 2 * np.pi * step) audio = tf.reshape(tf.cast(sine_wave, tf.float32), [1, -1, 1]) tf.summary.audio("my_audio", audio, sample_rate=48000, step=step)
 
This is actually a useful visualization tool to have, even beyond TensorFlow or Deep Learning.
Let’s summarize what you’ve learned so far in this chapter: we saw where neural nets came from, what an MLP is and how you can use it for classification and regression, how to use tf.keras’s Sequential API to build MLPs, and how to use the Functional API or the Subclassing API to build more complex model architectures. You learned how to save and restore a model and how to use callbacks for checkpointing, early stopping, and more. Finally, you learned how to use TensorBoard for visualization. You can already go ahead and use neural networks to tackle many problems! However, you may wonder how to choose the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in the network, and all the other hyperparameters. Let’s look at this now.
Fine-Tuning Neural Network Hyperparameters
The flexibility of neural networks is also one of their main drawbacks: there are many hyperparameters to tweak. Not only can you use any imaginable network architecture, but even in a simple MLP you can change the number of layers, the number of neurons per layer, the type of activation function to use in each layer, the weight initialization logic, and much more. How do you know what combination of hyperparameters is the best for your task?
One option is to simply try many combinations of hyperparameters and see which one works best on the validation set (or use K-fold cross-validation). For example, we can use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to explore the hyperparameter space, as we did in Chapter 2. To do this, we need to wrap our Keras models in objects that mimic regular Scikit-Learn regressors. The first step is to create a function that will build and compile a Keras model, given a set of hyperparameters:
def build_model(n_hidden=1, n_neurons=30, learning_rate=3e-3, input_shape=[8]): model = keras.models.Sequential() model.add(keras.layers.InputLayer(input_shape=input_shape))
for layer in range(n_hidden): model.add(keras.layers.Dense(n_neurons, activation="relu"))
model.add(keras.layers.Dense(1))
optimizer = keras.optimizers.SGD(lr=learning_rate) model.compile(loss="mse", optimizer=optimizer) return model
This function creates a simple Sequential model for univariate regression (only one output neuron), with the given input shape and the given number of hidden layers and neurons, and it compiles it using an SGD optimizer configured with the specified learning rate. It is good practice to provide reasonable defaults to as many hyperparameters as you can, as Scikit-Learn does.
Next, let’s create a KerasRegressor based on this build_model() function:
 
keras_reg = keras.wrappers.scikit_learn.KerasRegressor(build_model)
The KerasRegressor object is a thin wrapper around the Keras model built using build_model(). Since we did not specify any hyperparameters when creating it, it will use the default hyperparameters we defined in build_model(). Now we can use this object like a regular Scikit-Learn regressor: we can train it using its fit() method, then evaluate it using its score() method, and use it to make predictions using its predict() method, as you can see in the following code:
keras_reg.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100,
validation_data=(X_valid, y_valid), callbacks=[keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(patience=10)])
mse_test = keras_reg.score(X_test, y_test) y_pred = keras_reg.predict(X_new)
Note that any extra parameter you pass to the fit() method will get passed to the underlying Keras model. Also note that the score will be the opposite of the MSE because Scikit-Learn wants scores, not losses (i.e., higher should be better).
We don’t want to train and evaluate a single model like this, though we want to train hundreds of variants and see which one performs best on the validation set. Since there are many hyperparameters, it is preferable to use a randomized search rather than grid search (as we discussed in Chapter 2). Let’s try to explore the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons, and the learning rate:
from scipy.stats import reciprocal
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
param_distribs = { "n_hidden": [0, 1, 2, 3],
"n_neurons": np.arange(1, 100), "learning_rate": reciprocal(3e-4, 3e-2),
}
rnd_search_cv = RandomizedSearchCV(keras_reg, param_distribs, n_iter=10, cv=3) rnd_search_cv.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100,
validation_data=(X_valid, y_valid), callbacks=[keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(patience=10)])
This is identical to what we did in Chapter 2, except here we pass extra parameters to the fit() method, and they get relayed to the underlying Keras models. Note that RandomizedSearchCV uses K-fold cross-validation, so it does not use X_valid and y_valid, which are only used for early stopping.
The exploration may last many hours, depending on the hardware, the size of the dataset, the complexity of the model, and the values of n_iter and cv. When it’s over, you can access the best parameters found, the best score, and the trained Keras model like this:
 
>>> rnd_search_cv.best_params_
{'learning_rate': 0.0033625641252688094, 'n_hidden': 2, 'n_neurons': 42}
>>> rnd_search_cv.best_score_
-0.3189529188278931
>>> model = rnd_search_cv.best_estimator_.model
You can now save this model, evaluate it on the test set, and, if you are satisfied with its performance, deploy it to production. Using randomized search is not too hard, and it works well for many fairly simple problems. When training is slow, however (e.g., for more complex problems with larger datasets), this approach will only explore a tiny portion of the hyperparameter space. You can partially alleviate this problem by assisting the search process manually: first run a quick random search using wide ranges of hyperparameter values, then run another search using smaller ranges of values centered on the best ones found during the first run, and so on. This approach will hopefully zoom in on a good set of hyperparameters. However, it’s very time consuming, and probably not the best use of your time.
Fortunately, there are many techniques to explore a search space much more efficiently than randomly. Their core idea is simple: when a region of the space turns out to be good, it should be explored more. Such techniques take care of the “zooming” process for you and lead to much better solutions in much less time. Here are some Python libraries you can use to optimize hyperparameters:
Hyperopt
A popular library for optimizing over all sorts of complex search spaces (including real values, such as the learning rate, and discrete values, such as the number of layers).
Hyperas, kopt, or Talos
Useful libraries for optimizing hyperparameters for Keras models (the first two are based on Hyperopt).
Keras Tuner
An easy-to-use hyperparameter optimization library by Google for Keras models, with a hosted service for visualization and analysis.
Scikit-Optimize (skopt)
A general-purpose optimization library. The BayesSearchCV class performs Bayesian optimization using an interface similar to GridSearchCV.
Spearmint
A Bayesian optimization library.
 
Hyperband
A fast hyperparameter tuning library based on the recent Hyperband paper23 by Lisha Li et al.
Sklearn-Deap
A hyperparameter optimization library based on evolutionary algorithms, with a
GridSearchCV-like interface.
Moreover, many companies offer services for hyperparameter optimization. We’ll discuss Google Cloud AI Platform’s hyperparameter tuning service in Chapter 19. Other options include services by Arimo and SigOpt, and CallDesk’s Oscar.
Hyperparameter tuning is still an active area of research, and evolutionary algorithms are making a comeback. For example, check out DeepMind’s excellent 2017 paper,24 where the authors jointly optimize a population of models and their hyperparameters. Google has also used an evolutionary approach, not just to search for hyperparameters but also to look for the best neural network architecture for the problem; their AutoML suite is already available as a cloud service. Perhaps the days of building neural networks manually will soon be over? Check out Google’s post on this topic. In fact, evolutionary algorithms have been used successfully to train individual neural networks, replacing the ubiquitous Gradient Descent! For an example, see the 2017 post by Uber where the authors introduce their Deep Neuroevolution technique.
But despite all this exciting progress and all these tools and services, it still helps to have an idea of what values are reasonable for each hyperparameter so that you can build a quick prototype and restrict the search space. The following sections provide guidelines for choosing the number of hidden layers and neurons in an MLP and for selecting good values for some of the main hyperparameters.
Number of Hidden Layers
For many problems, you can begin with a single hidden layer and get reasonable results. An MLP with just one hidden layer can theoretically model even the most complex functions, provided it has enough neurons. But for complex problems, deep networks have a much higher parameter efficiency than shallow ones: they can model complex functions using exponentially fewer neurons than shallow nets, allowing them to reach much better performance with the same amount of training data.
To understand why, suppose you are asked to draw a forest using some drawing software, but you are forbidden to copy and paste anything. It would take an enormous

amount of time: you would have to draw each tree individually, branch by branch, leaf by leaf. If you could instead draw one leaf, copy and paste it to draw a branch, then copy and paste that branch to create a tree, and finally copy and paste this tree to make a forest, you would be finished in no time. Real-world data is often structured in such a hierarchical way, and deep neural networks automatically take advantage of this fact: lower hidden layers model low-level structures (e.g., line segments of various shapes and orientations), intermediate hidden layers combine these low-level structures to model intermediate-level structures (e.g., squares, circles), and the highest hidden layers and the output layer combine these intermediate structures to model high-level structures (e.g., faces).
Not only does this hierarchical architecture help DNNs converge faster to a good solution, but it also improves their ability to generalize to new datasets. For example, if you have already trained a model to recognize faces in pictures and you now want to train a new neural network to recognize hairstyles, you can kickstart the training by reusing the lower layers of the first network. Instead of randomly initializing the weights and biases of the first few layers of the new neural network, you can initialize them to the values of the weights and biases of the lower layers of the first network. This way the network will not have to learn from scratch all the low-level structures that occur in most pictures; it will only have to learn the higher-level structures (e.g., hairstyles). This is called transfer learning.
In summary, for many problems you can start with just one or two hidden layers and the neural network will work just fine. For instance, you can easily reach above 97% accuracy on the MNIST dataset using just one hidden layer with a few hundred neurons, and above 98% accuracy using two hidden layers with the same total number of neurons, in roughly the same amount of training time. For more complex problems, you can ramp up the number of hidden layers until you start overfitting the training set. Very complex tasks, such as large image classification or speech recognition, typically require networks with dozens of layers (or even hundreds, but not fully connected ones, as we will see in Chapter 14), and they need a huge amount of training data. You will rarely have to train such networks from scratch: it is much more common to reuse parts of a pretrained state-of-the-art network that performs a similar task. Training will then be a lot faster and require much less data (we will discuss this in Chapter 11).
Number of Neurons per Hidden Layer
The number of neurons in the input and output layers is determined by the type of input and output your task requires. For example, the MNIST task requires 28 × 28 = 784 input neurons and 10 output neurons.
As for the hidden layers, it used to be common to size them to form a pyramid, with fewer and fewer neurons at each layer—the rationale being that many low-level fea
 
tures can coalesce into far fewer high-level features. A typical neural network for MNIST might have 3 hidden layers, the first with 300 neurons, the second with 200, and the third with 100. However, this practice has been largely abandoned because it seems that using the same number of neurons in all hidden layers performs just as well in most cases, or even better; plus, there is only one hyperparameter to tune, instead of one per layer. That said, depending on the dataset, it can sometimes help to make the first hidden layer bigger than the others.
Just like the number of layers, you can try increasing the number of neurons gradually until the network starts overfitting. But in practice, it’s often simpler and more efficient to pick a model with more layers and neurons than you actually need, then use early stopping and other regularization techniques to prevent it from overfitting. Vincent Vanhoucke, a scientist at Google, has dubbed this the “stretch pants” approach: instead of wasting time looking for pants that perfectly match your size, just use large stretch pants that will shrink down to the right size. With this approach, you avoid bottleneck layers that could ruin your model. On the flip side, if a layer has too few neurons, it will not have enough representational power to preserve all the useful information from the inputs (e.g., a layer with two neurons can only output 2D data, so if it processes 3D data, some information will be lost). No matter how big and powerful the rest of the network is, that information will never be recovered.

In general you will get more bang for your buck by increasing the number of layers instead of the number of neurons per layer.



Learning Rate, Batch Size, and Other Hyperparameters
The numbers of hidden layers and neurons are not the only hyperparameters you can tweak in an MLP. Here are some of the most important ones, as well as tips on how to set them:
Learning rate
The learning rate is arguably the most important hyperparameter. In general, the optimal learning rate is about half of the maximum learning rate (i.e., the learning rate above which the training algorithm diverges, as we saw in Chapter 4). One way to find a good learning rate is to train the model for a few hundred iterations, starting with a very low learning rate (e.g., 10-5) and gradually increasing it up to a very large value (e.g., 10). This is done by multiplying the learning rate by a constant factor at each iteration (e.g., by exp(log(106)/500) to go from 10-5 to 10 in 500 iterations). If you plot the loss as a function of the learning rate (using a log scale for the learning rate), you should see it dropping at first. But after a while, the learning rate will be too large, so the loss will shoot back up: the opti
 
mal learning rate will be a bit lower than the point at which the loss starts to climb (typically about 10 times lower than the turning point). You can then reinitialize your model and train it normally using this good learning rate. We will look at more learning rate techniques in Chapter 11.
Optimizer
Choosing a better optimizer than plain old Mini-batch Gradient Descent (and tuning its hyperparameters) is also quite important. We will see several advanced optimizers in Chapter 11.
Batch size
The batch size can have a significant impact on your model’s performance and training time. The main benefit of using large batch sizes is that hardware accelerators like GPUs can process them efficiently (see Chapter 19), so the training algorithm will see more instances per second. Therefore, many researchers and practitioners recommend using the largest batch size that can fit in GPU RAM. There’s a catch, though: in practice, large batch sizes often lead to training instabilities, especially at the beginning of training, and the resulting model may not generalize as well as a model trained with a small batch size. In April 2018, Yann LeCun even tweeted “Friends don’t let friends use mini-batches larger than 32,” citing a 2018 paper25 by Dominic Masters and Carlo Luschi which concluded that using small batches (from 2 to 32) was preferable because small batches led to better models in less training time. Other papers point in the opposite direction, however; in 2017, papers by Elad Hoffer et al.26 and Priya Goyal et al.27 showed that it was possible to use very large batch sizes (up to 8,192) using various techniques such as warming up the learning rate (i.e., starting training with a small learning rate, then ramping it up, as we will see in Chapter 11). This led to a very short training time, without any generalization gap. So, one strategy is to try to use a large batch size, using learning rate warmup, and if training is unstable or the final performance is disappointing, then try using a small batch size instead.
Activation function
We discussed how to choose the activation function earlier in this chapter: in general, the ReLU activation function will be a good default for all hidden layers. For the output layer, it really depends on your task.

Number of iterations
In most cases, the number of training iterations does not actually need to be tweaked: just use early stopping instead.

The optimal learning rate depends on the other hyperparameters— especially the batch size—so if you modify any hyperparameter, make sure to update the learning rate as well.

This concludes our introduction to artificial neural networks and their implementation with Keras. In the next few chapters, we will discuss techniques to train very deep nets. We will also explore how to customize models using TensorFlow’s lower- level API and how to load and preprocess data efficiently using the Data API. And we will dive into other popular neural network architectures: convolutional neural networks for image processing, recurrent neural networks for sequential data, autoencoders for representation learning, and generative adversarial networks to model and generate data.29
Exercises
1.	The TensorFlow Playground is a handy neural network simulator built by the TensorFlow team. In this exercise, you will train several binary classifiers in just a few clicks, and tweak the model’s architecture and its hyperparameters to gain some intuition on how neural networks work and what their hyperparameters do. Take some time to explore the following:
a.	The patterns learned by a neural net. Try training the default neural network by clicking the Run button (top left). Notice how it quickly finds a good solution for the classification task. The neurons in the first hidden layer have learned simple patterns, while the neurons in the second hidden layer have learned to combine the simple patterns of the first hidden layer into more complex patterns. In general, the more layers there are, the more complex the patterns can be.
b.	Activation functions. Try replacing the tanh activation function with a ReLU activation function, and train the network again. Notice that it finds a solution

even faster, but this time the boundaries are linear. This is due to the shape of the ReLU function.
c.	The risk of local minima. Modify the network architecture to have just one hidden layer with three neurons. Train it multiple times (to reset the network weights, click the Reset button next to the Play button). Notice that the training time varies a lot, and sometimes it even gets stuck in a local minimum.
d.	What happens when neural nets are too small. Remove one neuron to keep just two. Notice that the neural network is now incapable of finding a good solution, even if you try multiple times. The model has too few parameters and systematically underfits the training set.
e.	What happens when neural nets are large enough. Set the number of neurons to eight, and train the network several times. Notice that it is now consistently fast and never gets stuck. This highlights an important finding in neural network theory: large neural networks almost never get stuck in local minima, and even when they do these local optima are almost as good as the global optimum. However, they can still get stuck on long plateaus for a long time.
f.	The risk of vanishing gradients in deep networks. Select the spiral dataset (the bottom-right dataset under “DATA”), and change the network architecture to have four hidden layers with eight neurons each. Notice that training takes much longer and often gets stuck on plateaus for long periods of time. Also notice that the neurons in the highest layers (on the right) tend to evolve faster than the neurons in the lowest layers (on the left). This problem, called the “vanishing gradients” problem, can be alleviated with better weight initialization and other techniques, better optimizers (such as AdaGrad or Adam), or Batch Normalization (discussed in Chapter 11).
g.	Go further. Take an hour or so to play around with other parameters and get a feel for what they do, to build an intuitive understanding about neural networks.
2.	Draw an ANN using the original artificial neurons (like the ones in Figure 10-3) that computes A ⊕ B (where ⊕ represents the XOR operation). Hint: A ⊕ B = (A ∧ ¬ B) ∨ (¬ A ∧ B).
3.	Why is it generally preferable to use a Logistic Regression classifier rather than a classical Perceptron (i.e., a single layer of threshold logic units trained using the Perceptron training algorithm)? How can you tweak a Perceptron to make it equivalent to a Logistic Regression classifier?
4.	Why was the logistic activation function a key ingredient in training the first MLPs?
5.	Name three popular activation functions. Can you draw them?
 
6.	Suppose you have an MLP composed of one input layer with 10 passthrough neurons, followed by one hidden layer with 50 artificial neurons, and finally one output layer with 3 artificial neurons. All artificial neurons use the ReLU activation function.
•	What is the shape of the input matrix X?
•	What are the shapes of the hidden layer’s weight vector Wh and its bias vector
bh?
•	What are the shapes of the output layer’s weight vector Wo and its bias vector
bo?
•	What is the shape of the network’s output matrix Y?
•	Write the equation that computes the network’s output matrix Y as a function of X, Wh, bh, Wo, and bo.
7.	How many neurons do you need in the output layer if you want to classify email into spam or ham? What activation function should you use in the output layer? If instead you want to tackle MNIST, how many neurons do you need in the output layer, and which activation function should you use? What about for getting your network to predict housing prices, as in Chapter 2?
8.	What is backpropagation and how does it work? What is the difference between backpropagation and reverse-mode autodiff?
9.	Can you list all the hyperparameters you can tweak in a basic MLP? If the MLP overfits the training data, how could you tweak these hyperparameters to try to solve the problem?
10.	Train a deep MLP on the MNIST dataset (you can load it using keras.data sets.mnist.load_data(). See if you can get over 98% precision. Try searching for the optimal learning rate by using the approach presented in this chapter (i.e., by growing the learning rate exponentially, plotting the loss, and finding the point where the loss shoots up). Try adding all the bells and whistles—save checkpoints, use early stopping, and plot learning curves using TensorBoard.
